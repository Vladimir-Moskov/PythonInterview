# technical / code interview for EclecticIQ

"""
Hi Volodymyr,

Thank you for your application. In order to make an assessment of your Python knowledge and eye for detail,
we'd like to ask you to complete a short assignment.

I've attached a piece of code that I'd like you to review as if it was a regular code review -
 imagine you're a senior member of a team and a junior asks for your approval. Point out whatever flaws you find,
 explain them if necessary, and maybe even point out some suggestions on how to do things better.

We would prefer to see your review as a set of in-line comments in the Python module,
but you're free to choose another way if it works better for you.

Please submit the assignment by 2019-12-03. Thank you!

Best regards,
EclecticIQ

This module contains code that:

1. fetches a product record, containing product manual details,
   from some SQL database,
2. uses ImageMagic via shell to covert PDF product manual into
   a JPEG byte stream.

Your task is to uncover as many issues as you can.

# General conclusions: original code does not have any comments, pydocs documentation with is not good practice.
# Variable/Class/Function names are mostly self described, code follow PEP 8 - so it deserves  some credits for this.

# 1 - Absolute import preferable over Relative
# 99% of cases Use absolute import instead relative, unless you know what you are doing,
# generally speaking Relative import is bad practice in this particular example.
# Relative imports are also not as readable as absolute ones, and itâ€™s not easy to tell the location of the imported
# resources and can make cause problems when project files/folders will be moving around.

# sponsored_id_list should not be created on the module level,
# if it is going to be used only by ProductFinder as static
# variable then should be  moved  on class level. Also the point to create another references we can use
# config.get_sponsored() directly
# The right usage of sponsored_id_list really depends on implementation of - config.get_sponsored()
# A case - config.get_sponsored() is just wrapper of config file and/or just static data holder -
# just use config.get_sponsored()
# B case - config.get_sponsored() do some heavy calculations or/and dp/server/.. calls - and it make sense to create
# variable to keep it - so just move it inside ProductFinder
