What started as a way to manage multiple servers on one system has grown into the way we develop, write code, ship applications, and coordinate large scale applications! Containers may have started as tools for the ops team, but now everyone needs to learn to build and use them. In this course youâ€™ll learn, what containers are and how to create containers from scratch, how to run containers from Dockerhub, how to create your own containers with Docker files, best practices are for front-end and Node.js code in containers, and how to create development environments with containers.

Introduction
Introduction
00:00:00 - 00:08:24
Introduction
Brian Holt gives an overview of the course, explains why containers are a relevant topic for any software engineer, discusses what needs to be installed to follow along, and shares where to file issues with the course. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/
Containers
Containers
00:08:25 - 00:21:53
Containers
Brian gives a brief history of why containers are useful tools that host controlled and isolated environments, thanks to a frozen file system. The latter allowed engineers to have access to ready to use containers without having to recreate all the dependencies and file system on a local machine. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/what-are-containers
chroot
00:21:54 - 00:34:45
chroot
Brian explains that chroot is a Linux kernel feature that allows the containment of processes, restricts a process to a certain file tree, and uses chroot to add bash commands to the bash directory. A chroot operation is necessary to understand how containers are layered to limit or deny access outside of a designated directory tree. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/chroot
chroot Exercise
00:34:46 - 00:35:40
chroot Exercise
Students are instructed to use the chroot process to make the bash command cat function within the bash directory.
chroot Solution
00:35:41 - 00:37:43
chroot Solution
Brian live codes the solution to the chroot exercise.
Namespaces
00:37:44 - 00:52:08
Namespaces
Brian explains that namespaces are useful to hide processes, networks, and other configurations from other environments, and demonstrates how to configure namespaces and use a command nammed unshare to seperate environments. The parent process has access to the child process, but the child cannot access the parent. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/namespaces
cgroups
00:52:09 - 01:09:20
cgroups
Brian explains that cgroups were invented by Google to limit what resources a process can access to avoid entire servers shutting down, and demonstrates how to manually use cgroups to restrict processes. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/cgroups
Docker
Getting Set Up with Docker
01:09:21 - 01:12:47
Getting Set Up with Docker
Brian explains that Docker is a command line tool that makes building and managing containers easier, and that has environments built in various languages. Docker allows engineers to build a container in less time and fewer lines of code because it manages chroot, namespaces, and cgroups for the engineer. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/getting-set-up-with-docker
Docker Images without Docker
01:12:48 - 01:20:01
Docker Images without Docker

Docker Images with Docker
01:20:02 - 01:31:20
Docker Images with Docker
Brian demonstrates how to use a one line command to build a container instead of using the longer process live coded in the previous section, explains that images take memory space, and shows how to prune them. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/docker-images-with-docker
Node.js on Docker
01:31:21 - 01:38:35
Node.js on Docker
Brian demonstrates how to create a Node.js container that uses Debian instead of Ubuntu after mentioning that there is a wide variety of containers using different libraries and laguages. Debian is used instead of Ubuntu because Node images were created in Debian. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/nodejs-on-docker
Tags
01:38:36 - 01:47:34
Tags
Brian explains that it is important to tie tags to specific versions when creating environments to avoid dependency issues that would break the code, and shares the rules of thumb when picking tags to build a container. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/tags
Docker CLI
01:47:35 - 02:02:46
Docker CLI
Brian shares a few commands in the Docker CLI that give the container's history, pause the container, erase the container, or run a container with, and how to prune stopped containers. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/docker-cli
The Dockerfile
Dockerfiles Preamble
02:02:47 - 02:14:41

EXPOSE
02:41:59 - 02:46:17
EXPOSE
Brian explains what port mapping is using EXPOSE, a Dockerfile command that explicitly instructs users to check a specific port, and demonstrates that it is more convinient to add this information to the markdown of a specific app, instead of Dockerfile. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/expose
Layers
02:46:18 - 02:50:53
Layers
Brian demonstrates that a Docker container is composed of layers, and explains how to add a COPY command to the Docker file that will cache the layers of the built container and skip right to the new added layers when rebuilding a container. - https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/layers
Docker Ignore
02:50:54 - 02:53:51
Docker Ignore
Brian demonstrates how to add a dockerignore file, and explains that the files mentioned within the dockerignore document are files that should not be copied from the host operating system into the container, but that are still necessary within a project.
Making Tiny Containers
Alpine Linux
